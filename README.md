# object-factory-util
Project with use case example of my class [**ObjectFactoryUtil**](https://github.com/gregoryfeijon/object-factory-util/blob/main/src/main/java/br/com/gregoryfeijon/objectfactoryutil/util/ObjectFactoryUtil.java), that can be useful to create a completely new object from another one with the same type (with new object references, even for Lists, Maps and others wrapper types), or even with ANY other type, as long as the objects has attributes with same names. Implementation created to any project.

Here's an implementation created specially for Spring projects:

# [object-factory-util-spring](https://github.com/gregoryfeijon/object-factory-util-spring)
