# object-factory-util
Project with use case example of my class [**ObjectFactoryUtil**](https://github.com/gregoryfeijon/object-factory-util/blob/main/src/main/java/br/com/gregoryfeijon/objectfactoryutil/util/ObjectFactoryUtil.java), that can be useful to create a completely new object from another one with the same type (with new object references, even for Lists, Maps and others wrapper types). Implementation created to any Java project.

Here's an implementation created specially for Spring projects:

# [object-factory-util-spring](https://github.com/gregoryfeijon/object-factory-util-spring)
